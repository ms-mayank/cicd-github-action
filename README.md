## This repo is dedicated to give a quick idea about CI/cd and Github action
### STEPS
1. Create repo and other files.
2. Using pytest to test the unit test cases.
3. test folder - pytest looks for test folder to execute all the test cases and inside the test folder all the files should be start with test_<file_name>.
4. Commit and push repo.
5. Using Github Action to automate this unit testing i.e. whenever there is any action as such code is pushed to repo then run an action to test these cases.

### Github Action 
6. create .github folder > workflows folder > yml file
7. define all the actions in yml file.
